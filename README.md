## Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ :earth_americas:

I am Liam, and I love code... maybe unhealthily so. I have working knowledge of PHP, JS, Dart, Ruby (all of which I have worked with professionally). But I don't stop there. Personally, I additionally like to play around with Python, Rust, and whatever other technologies tickle my fancy.

I am fascinated with the web, but my professional career has expanded my horizons to the exciting world of native apps 
(via Flutter ðŸ’™). You will see a wide array of projects in my Github profile, because I never stop learning and growing. Just approach my code with caution, as some (most) of it may be very out of date, poorly written, reallly a testement to my growth in terms of learning better patterns to structure my code, etc.

Aside from coding, I want to leave the world in a better place than I found it. I love to help others.
